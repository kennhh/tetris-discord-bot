# tetris-bot
a discord bot to play tetris on using interactions.py

### some known issues/incomplete features
- to fully reset the board, the bot needs to be restarted
- when using components, spamming of exceptions
- using left/right can pass blocks into other blocks
- no game over, so block stacking at the end will be prevelant
- this bot needs to pass args through tasks which isn't already in interactions.py (at least as of 5.5.0). if needed, i can provide the changes that i made
