# tetris-bot
a discord bot to play tetris on using interactions.py

### some known issues/incomplete features
- when using components, spamming of exceptions
- this bot needs to pass args through tasks which isn't already in interactions.py (at least as of 5.5.0). if needed, i can provide the changes that i made

### latest
- game over added and resets the grid without the need to restart the bot
- added left/right collision detection
- better centering for tetrominoes in holding and spawning
